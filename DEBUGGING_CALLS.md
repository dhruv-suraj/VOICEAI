2. Try to make a call
3. Look for request to `api.vapi.ai/call`

{
  "message": "Assistant not found",
  "code": "ASSISTANT_NOT_FOUND"
}

// No phone number configured
{
  "message": "No outbound phone number configured",
  "code": "NO_PHONE_NUMBER"
}

## üìû Test Different Phone Numbers

Try these test numbers:
```
+1-202-555-0173
+1-415-555-1234
+44-20-7946-0958
```

If calls work with one but not others, the issue is likely phone number format.

## üÜò Still Not Working?

If you're still getting errors after checking everything:

1. **Take a screenshot** of the console error
2. **Check these in Vapi dashboard**:
   - Your private API key is correct
   - Your assistant ID exists
   - You have phone numbers configured
   - Your account has credits
   - Your assistant is published

3. **Try from Vapi Dashboard** directly to verify:
   - Go to https://dashboard.vapi.ai/test
   - Try making a test call
   - If it works there, the issue is in your UI code
   - If it fails there, the issue is in your Vapi account setup

4. **Common Vapi Setup Issues**:
   - Account not verified
   - No payment method on file
   - Phone numbers not in correct region
   - Assistant not properly configured with voice

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Use Console Logging
The updated code logs everything. Check console for:
- ‚úÖ API key format
- ‚úÖ Request payload
- ‚úÖ Response status
- ‚úÖ Error details

### 2. Test with Simple Number
Start with a basic format:
```
+1-202-555-0173
```

Not:
```
(202) 555-0173
202-555-0173
2025550173
```

### 3. Check Vapi Credits
Even if everything else is correct, you need active credits to make calls.

### 4. Restart After Changes
- Change `.env.local`?
- Kill dev server (Ctrl+C)
- Run `npm run dev`
- Refresh browser
